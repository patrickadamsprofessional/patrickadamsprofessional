patrick here

I program simple tasks and systems, sometime they get to moderate levels of complexity.  My most frequent pattern is gluing together other, bigger systems, and adding side-loaded database support to legacy networking applications.  People call it netdevops, but mostly it is just supporting telecom engineering teams so that they can power through corporate take-overs of other commercial networks.

I used to spend a lot of time making random versions of rancid work with random peices of hardware and random custom databases.  Now I am working to build my own generic nornir+netbox config collection & management library and use it in commercial cases.
