patrick here

I program simple tasks and systems.  Gluing together other, bigger, systems and adding side-loaded database support to legacy networking applications.  People call it devops, but mostly it is just supporting engineering teams to power through corporate take-overs of other commercial networks.

I spend a lot of time making random versions of rancid work with random peices of hardware.
